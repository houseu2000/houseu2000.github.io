				<h1>Jiale Hou 侯佳乐</h1>
				<p>
					Hi, welcome to my website! I'm Jiale Hou, an MS student majoring in civil engineering at 
					<a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/" >Southeast University(China)</a>. 
					At present, I am carrying out research on the application of machine learning in structural health monitoring under the guidance of 
					<a href="https://civil.seu.edu.cn/2012/0221/c1269a93760/page.htm" >Prof. Chunfeng Wan</a>
					 and <a href="https://civil.seu.edu.cn/2009/1109/c1269a93718/page.htm" >Prof. Youliang Ding</a>.
					 My research interests are: physics informed machine learning, transfer learning and Bayesian learning.

				<h3>1. Missing data imputation for structural health monitoring system </h3>
				<img src="img/res1.PNG" width="800">
				<p>
					Sensors are the most important part of structural health monitoring systems (SHMSs), however they
					will be abnormal sometimes due to their deterioration or environment effect, 
					which will result in data loss during the health monitoring process of the structures. 
					We developed a novel data imputation framework based on<b> deep learning and data augmentation technique</b>, 
					which enables the application of data modeling and missing data imputation based on the less 
					remaining data when multiple sensors fail. Data imputation can be made between the same type 
					of sensors (STSs) and also different types of sensors (DTSs). The proposed methods are verified on the dataset of a real concrete bridge 
					located in China, and results show that proposed method achieves good performance.Besides, we are now trying to use
					<b>Bayesian tensor learning </b>to impute missing and abnormal data in SHMSs.

				<h3>2. Automatic identification of vortex induced vibration of long span bridges </h3>
				<img src="img/res2.PNG" width="800">
				<p>
					This study proposes an automatic vortex induced vibration (VIV) identification method using<b> support vector machine (SVM)</b> 
					and the <b>transfer learning technique</b>, 
					which can identify VIV in real-time or in the SHM historical dataset. It is worth noting that this 
					method does not need VIV data on the target dataset. The strong generalization ability and high 
					accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are 
					verified on the SHM dataset of a long-span suspension bridge and simulated VIV acceleration data 
					of 2-DOF system.

				<h3>3. Automatic identification of vortex induced vibration of long span bridges </h3>
				<img src="img/res3.jpg" width="800">
				<p>
					Since the Timoshenko beam was introduced to engineering fields, many efforts have been devoted and many problems are yet to handle.
					Based on the classical Timoshenko beam theory,<b> the rotary inertia caused by the shear deformation 
					is further considered</b> and the dynamic response under forced vibration is derived. It is found that the effect of the shear deformation induced rotary inertia is small for 
					   thin and slender beams; however, it is evident for short and deep beams with high stiffness. We believed that the proposed modified Timoshenko beam theory is a more reasonable, uncomplicated, and accurate
						 model to calculate the responses of the beam under forced vibration.
